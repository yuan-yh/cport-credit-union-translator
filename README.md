I need to build a functional prototype for cPort Credit Union's real-time translation tool. This is an MVP focused on serving Maine's immigrant communities with multilingual banking support.

Please read these documentation files to understand the project context and requirements:
- PROJECT_BRIEF.md (business context and goals)
- REQUIREMENTS.md (technical constraints and must-haves)
- FEATURES.md (MVP feature specifications)
- TECH_STACK.md (technology decisions)

After reviewing these files, I need you to:

1. Confirm your understanding of the core concept: A greeter-centric translation system for credit union staff to serve multilingual customers
2. Identify the key MVP features to prototype first
3. Suggest a simplified project structure for rapid prototyping

This prototype should demonstrate:
- Basic greeter interface (iPad-optimized)
- Simple teller interface 
- Mock translation functionality (no real APIs yet)
- Basic queue management
- Session handoff between roles

Focus on the user workflow and interface rather than complex backend features. We can add real translation APIs later.

What's your understanding of the project and what should we build first?
