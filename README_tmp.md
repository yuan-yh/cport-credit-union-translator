# cPort Credit Union Translation Tool

**Real-time multilingual banking support for Maine's immigrant communities**

## Project Overview

The cPort Credit Union Translation Tool is an AI-powered real-time translation system designed to serve Maine's diverse immigrant populations through personalized, culturally-sensitive banking services. This MVP prototype demonstrates the core workflow of a greeter-centric translation system that enhances rather than replaces human interaction.

### Core Concept

- **Greeter-First Approach**: Universal bankers use iPads to welcome customers, identify language needs, and provide initial translation support
- **Staff-Mediated Translation**: Technology enhances human interaction - staff remain the primary interface with customers
- **Seamless Handoffs**: Customers flow from greeter (iPad) â†’ teller (desktop) â†’ private consultor (desktop) with full conversation context preserved
- **Cultural Banking Focus**: Translations fine-tuned for credit union terminology ("member" vs "customer", "share draft accounts", etc.)

## Supported Languages

- **Portuguese** (1,600+ speakers in Maine - primarily Angolan community)
- **French** (39,000+ speakers - Congolese community using Belgian French)
- **Somali** (2,400+ speakers - including Somali Bantu variations)
- **Arabic** (1,500+ speakers - multiple regional dialects)
- **Spanish** (14,000+ speakers - diverse Latin American origins)

## MVP Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Must-Have Features (Phase 1)

- âœ… AI-powered service recommendation

#### Teller Interface (Desktop)

- âœ… Simple wait time estimates

### ðŸš€ Nice-to-Have Features (Phase 2+)
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Real translation API integration
- Document upload and translation
- Enhanced UI features and animations
- Automated customer feedback collection

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for consistent, accessible components
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Socket.io Client** for real-time communication
- **Vite** for fast development and building

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Socket.io** for real-time WebSocket communication

## User Workflows

### 1. Greeter Workflow (iPad)
1. Customer approaches greeter station
2. Greeter selects customer's language
3. Greeter uses push-to-talk for initial conversation
4. System recommends service type (Simple Transaction vs Complex Service)
5. Greeter captures basic customer information
6. Customer assigned to appropriate queue (teller or private consultation)
7. Session context transferred to next staff member

### 2. Teller Workflow (Desktop)
1. Teller receives notification of new customer in queue
2. Teller reviews customer context and conversation history
3. Customer arrives at teller window
4. Teller uses split-screen interface (banking system + translation)
5. Real-time translation during transaction processing
6. Transaction confirmation in both languages
7. Service completion with summary generation

### 3. Private Consultor Workflow (Desktop)
1. Consultor receives complex service customers
2. Extended session management (30-60 minutes)
3. Document upload and translation support
4. Multi-step service progress tracking
5. Financial product explanations in customer's language
